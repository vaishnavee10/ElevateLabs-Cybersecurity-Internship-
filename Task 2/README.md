# Task 2 - Phishing Email Analysis

This folder contains my analysis of a phishing email sample as part of my cybersecurity internship task.

## What I did
- Analyzed a phishing email sample (`phishing_email_sample.txt`).
- Checked the sender address, links, and email content for phishing traits.
- Ran the email header through online header analyzers.
- Identified spoofing, failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks, and social engineering tactics.
